Applications:
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios
- md5
- PostgreSQL
- pg
- Postman API Platform

The API provided always resulted in an authentication error, so I implemented my own with a similar setup.

Application Flow:
1. User Registration: Accepts new user registration data via a POST request to /register endpoint.
2. Fetching Additional User Information: Retrieves user information from an external API using Axios.
3. Handling API Responses: Checks API response status codes for authentication, request errors, or successful retrieval.
4. Database Interaction: Stores user data into PostgreSQL database after successful registration and API response.

Setup and Configuration:
- Express setup for handling HTTP requests.
- PostgreSQL connection established using pg package.
- Route defined for user registration endpoint.
- Server initialized to listen for incoming requests.
- Postman to send POST requests.

Improvements:
- Remove hardcoding.
- Prevent possible sql injections.
